Dear IBMer,

Our Business Conduct Guidelines are framed as a living document, and they’re aimed at ensuring that every IBMer’s actions and relationships – be it with clients, investors, colleagues and the communities in which we live and work – are grounded in our values as individuals and as an enterprise. And as times change, IBM’s values endure. As our former CEO and the son of our founder, Thomas Watson, Jr., put it in A Business and Its Beliefs:

If an organization is to meet the challenges of a changing world, it must be prepared to change everything about itself except its beliefs as it moves forward in its corporate life.

Now, like IBM itself, our BCGs are grounded in our basic values, and they also need to be continually refreshed to address new conditions, new business practices, new technologies and new challenges. Today, we are introducing an updated edition of the BCGs, built around IBMers’ core Value of “Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships,” and written to guide each of us through the fast-moving and complex business environments in which we all work.
